# ODrive_Linear_Actuator (in active development)
This code is meant for controlling Linear Actuators with the ODrive controller. This automatically sets the bounds of the linear actuator by checking position change and then the move_in_procents function can be used to move in procents betwen the self established bounds.

# 3d models
Some 3d models are also included as a Linear Actuator Example.
